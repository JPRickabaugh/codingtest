1. Run this app in a local testing server. Once the server is running, take a screenshot of your terminal window and add it to your images folder (screenshots on Mac: shift + command + 4) (screenshots in Windows: search ‘snip’ in the control panel to open the snipping tool) ✓

2. In your JS file, you'll see a function called foo(). It's broken. Fix it. You shouldn't need to add any new lines of code. ✓

3. Open Desktop.png and Mobile.png from your images folder. Build those designs as closely as possible. I’ve already laid out the HTML for you. You just need to create the Grid in your CSS. 

4. Initialize a LOCAL Git repo and make a commit with the message ‘Built the grid’

5. Add four menu items to your #header, matching the design in menu-items.png

6. Make another local commit with the message, ‘Added the menu items’

7. Using CSS, make the menu items change to the background image (thumbs-up.jpg) on hover. The images should be contained and centered nicely.

8. Using either jQuery or vanilla JS, make the #offscreen-nav appear when you click the hamburger button and close when you click the X. Note: For each JS problem, please include a comment at the top of your code block to indicate that it's the solution to the problem, e.g., //Answer to Problem 8.

9. Meet Brenda. Brenda is 20 years old. Right now, she is happy, and if she’s happy when meets someone, she says hello to that person. If she’s unhappy, she tells that person to bug off. Make a JS object called ‘student’ that represents all of the things I just said. Console log her name.

10. Brenda is unhappy today, and she meets a man named Steve. Use the object you just created to alert her message to Steve.

11. Make a third commit with the message, ‘Finished the Brenda problem.'

12. Write and use a function that multiples any two given numbers and logs the result.

13. Load the data from nations.json asynchronously and log the data to your console.

14. Now, loop through the data to build HTML content. The HTML should show the names of all the nations with more than 400 airports. It does not need to be in list format. Display the HTML content in the div #main-top-panel.

15. Make another local commit with the message, ‘Looped through the JSON data.’

16. Push this app to a remote GitHub repo. Paste the link in Sakai (if you are unable to push to GitHub, zip the app folder and upload to Sakai).
